    <p>True country music is all but gone from the mainstream airways. It’s been replaced by over produced pop repackaged as country music from Nashville and over produced Southern Rock repackaged and called Texas or Red Dirt Music. It’s become so watered down that when I tell people I play country music they’re never sure what to think. That’s why I started telling people I play honky-tonk music. It seems to get the point across. The word honky-tonk makes people think of Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell in Nashville, Bob Wills and Ernest Tubb in Texas, or Buck Owens and Dwight Yoakum in Bakersfield. It makes people think of steel guitars, fiddles, and sliding across the dance floor. I want my music to make people think of all of those things as well. I’m not some pretty boy singing pretty songs about pretty things. I’m a little rough, and I sing rough songs about rough things because life can be rough. I don’t play any rock songs in my set, and I won’t know most of your requests. What I will give you is a damn good show with old songs that were originally done by people with a passion for real country music, and now done by a guy with a passion for real country music. What I will give you is original songs written and performed with that same passion. What I will give you is honky-tonk!</p>
