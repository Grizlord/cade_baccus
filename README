== Welcome to Band App ==

This is an app I've been working on for Cade Baccus, a local Austin TX singer song writer that has been evolving into a full fledged app that can be used by any band to create a fully interactive band website for their fans. Just change the logo and tweak the HTML and CSS to meet their needs and thats it!

The site is hosted on Heroku and the uploads are on Amazon S3.

== Gems ==

nifty-generators
CanCan
bcrypt-ruby(used with CanCan)
carrierwave (for picture and song uploads)
rmagic(used with carrierwave)
fog(also used with carrierwave)

nifty-generators and CanCan are Ryan Bate's creations and I love them.

== JQuery plug-ins ==

Nivo-Slider
Throbber
Slimbox2
Easytabs

Its not JQuery but the music players are SoundManager2.

I combined most of the Jquery files into one called combined.js.

Special thanks to Ryan Bates @ railscasts.com. I wouldn't have been able to figure out most of the things implemented on the app without him.

If you have any questions or want to help me out with some suggestions on how to clean up my ugly novice code drop me a line at grizlord@gmail.com.
